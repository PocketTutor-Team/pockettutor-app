# Milestone M2: Team Feedback

This milestone M2 provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on two major themes:
First, whether you have adopted good software engineering practices and are making progress toward delivering value to your users.
Is your design and implementation of high quality, easy to maintain, and well tested?
Second, we look at how well you are functioning as a team, how you organize yourselves, and how well you have refined your collaborative development.
An important component is also how much you have progressed, as a team, since the previous milestone.
You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document.
As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

We looked at several aspects, grouped as follows:

 - Design
   - [Features](#design-features)
   - [Design Documentation](#design-documentation)
 - [Implementation and Delivery](#implementation-and-delivery)
 - Scrum
   - [Backlogs Maintenance](#scrum-backlogs-maintenance)
   - [Documentation and Ceremonies](#scrum-documentation-and-ceremonies)
   - [Continuous Delivery of Value](#scrum-continuous-delivery-of-value)

## Design: Features

We interacted with your app from a user perspective, assessing each implemented feature and flagging any issues encountered. Our evaluation focused mainly on essential features implemented during Sprints 3, 4, and 5; any additional features planned for future Sprints were not considered in this assessment unless they induced buggy behavior in the current APK.
We examined the completeness of each feature in the current version of the app, and how well it aligns with user needs and the overall project goals.


The app is functioning well overall, and the features you implemented meet our expectations for this milestone. However, during testing, we noticed a few bugs and inconsistencies that need to be addressed to achieve a more polished and M3-ready version of the app. Here are some remarks:

- All user inputs should be sanitized to prevent long strings from breaking the UI. Currently, the profile screen is not scrollable, leading to layout issues when fields contain excessively long text entries.
- Reload bug: clicking the same tab in the bottom navigation bar reloads the page unnecessarily.
- The color of the date and time pickers does not align with the app’s theme.
- Date selection allows for years far in the future (e.g., 2050); this should have a reasonable limit.
- More subjects for lessons should be added.
- Be consistent with the use of uppercase and lowercase letters throughout the app.
- Dropdown menus should not be expandable if empty, or they should display a message indicating that they are empty when expanded.
- The system’s top bar color should be adjusted (currently deep purple by default).
- Users should be able to force close the app while staying signed in.
- Clarify phone number input (e.g., mention the country code).
- When adding a description for a tutor's profile, the keyboard cannot be dismissed easily.
- Consider adding a select all/deselect all option for the availability selection screen.
- Automatically capitalize the first letter of the name and last name when displayed in the UI.
- Include current location on the screen where students choose the lesson location.
- The calendar icon is not updated to the current date on the “find a student” screen.
- The filter icon in the “find a student” screen is unclear and should be changed to better indicate its purpose.
- Users should be able to sign out.
- The "ask other tutor for your lesson" button is unclear; consider using a different label for clarity.
- In the “My Courses” tab, dropdowns should indicate they contain content when collapsed.
- The "confirm" button in the "edit requested lesson" screen should be renamed to "update" and only be clickable when changes are made.
- The location component in the “confirm the lesson" tab appears abruptly; using a loading screen while waiting for the whole screen to load would be smoother.
- Consider language compatibility when both the student and tutor speak multiple languages. What language should be displayed in the lesson UI?
- There should be an option to cancel a lesson or mark it as done.

Please keep in mind that some of these remarks may already be on your radar and planned for future work, so feel free to disregard them if they are already being addressed.


For this part, you received 7.5 points out of a maximum of 8.0.

## Design: Documentation

We reviewed your Figma (including wireframes and mockups) and the evolution of your overall design architecture in the three Sprints.
We assessed how you leveraged Figma to reason about the UX, ensure a good UX, and facilitate fast UI development.
We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure.


Your Figma design is exceptionally well done, and the UI looks great both in the design and in the app itself—fantastic job on this! The architecture diagram is also well structured and clearly presented. Keep up the great work!


For this part, you received 5.7 points out of a maximum of 6.0.

## Implementation and Delivery

We evaluated several aspects of your app's implementation, including code quality, testing, CI practices, and the functionality and quality of the APK.
We assessed whether your code is well modularized, readable, and maintainable.
We looked at the efficiency and effectiveness of your unit and end-to-end tests, and at the line coverage they achieve.


Your code looks good overall and follows many good practices. However, some recurring comments from your individual grading feedback apply to the entire project. Firstly, make sure to move all UI strings to a strings.xml file in your resources, rather than using hardcoded strings. This will help create more modular code, especially for screens using the same text, and will also support accessibility features like adapting the text to the user’s preferred language. Additionally, consider adding more documentation for your functions to enhance code readability and make it easier for reviewers, even those outside the project. The APK runs smoothly overall, but there are a few nitpicks that we’ll need to discuss. Your line coverage is excellent, but for the next milestone, be sure to address the feedback from your individual grading to align even more closely with best practices.


For this part, you received 13.8 points out of a maximum of 16.0.

## Scrum: Backlogs Maintenance

We looked at whether your Scrum board is up-to-date and well organized.
We evaluated your capability to organize Sprint 6 and whether you provided a clear overview of this planning on the Scrum board.
We assessed the quality of your user stories and epics: are they clearly defined, are they aligned with a user-centric view of the app, and do they suitably guide you in delivering the highest value possible.


Your Scrum board is solid overall but could benefit from some fine-tuning. In your sprint backlog, consider using task descriptions to indicate risk planning and provide more detailed information. For the product backlog, it would be helpful to brainstorm additional ideas for future features, assign priorities to your user stories, and include more detailed descriptions. These adjustments can help streamline your planning and enhance the overall clarity of your board.


For this part, you received 3 points out of a maximum of 4.0.

## Scrum: Documentation and Ceremonies

We assessed how you used the Scrum process to organize yourselves efficiently.
We looked at how well you documented your team Retrospective and Stand-Up during each Sprint.
We also evaluated your autonomy in using Scrum.


Your team has shown a strong overall performance. The documentation is consistently thorough, meetings are well-structured, and your planning is effective. There’s a clear sense of independence and strong teamwork, with minimal need for external guidance. However, there are moments when we notice some underlying tension during meetings, and the concerned members could work on improving how they contribute to discussions to ensure smoother communication. Keep building on this strong foundation while addressing these areas.


For this part, you received 3.9 points out of a maximum of 4.0.

## Scrum: Continuous Delivery of Value

We evaluated the Increment you delivered at the end of each Sprint, assessing your team’s ability to continuously add value to the app.
This included an assessment of whether the way you organized the Sprints was conducive to an optimal balance between effort invested and delivery of value.


Your team consistently delivered value throughout the sprints, showing clear improvements in features, UI/UX, and app robustness. The steady progress reflects strong organization and focus, resulting in noticeable enhancements to the product. Great job—keep it up!


For this part, you received 2 points out of a maximum of 2.0.
